# ANALYSIS-OF-MALARIA-INCIDENCE-IN-AFRICA-2007-2017-
analysis of malaria incidence across African countries over a ten-year period (2007–2017)

This report presents an analysis of malaria incidence across African countries over a ten-year period (2007–2017). The analysis highlights key trends, identifies areas of improvement, and offers actionable recommendations for stakeholders. The study examines data on confirmed malaria cases, preventive measures (such as insecticide-treated bed nets and antimalarial medications), and access to sanitation services.

Key Insights

1.	Total Malaria Cases
   
i.	A total of 588 million malaria cases were reported during the study period.

ii.	Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) had the highest burden with 78 million cases, followed by Mozambique with 44 million cases.

iii.	Countries with no recorded malaria cases: Tunisia, Mauritius, Libya, Morocco, Seychelles, Egypt, and Lesotho.

3.	Treatment of Children with Fever
   
o	3,680 children with fever were receiving antimalarial treatment across the continent.

o	Leading countries in this category include:

i.	Liberia: 304 children

ii.	Uganda: 273 children

iii.	Tanzania: 257 children

iv.	Nigeria: 28 children

5.	Access to Safe Sanitation Services
   
o	Key countries with notable urban and rural sanitation service usage include:

i.	Djibouti: 410 (urban), 177 (rural)

ii.	Nigeria: 308 (urban), 268 (rural)

iii.	Senegal: 203 (urban), 207 (rural)

iv.	Tanzania: 287 (urban), 188 (rural)

o	Mali demonstrated better rural sanitation access (213 rural vs. 94 urban).

7.	Countries with Highest Malaria Incidence Rates
   
i.	Burkina Faso: 5,330 cases (22.7%)

ii.	Sierra Leone: 4,600 cases (19.57%)

iii.	Central African Republic: 4,540 cases (19.31%)

9.	Population Growth Trends
    
o	Urban Population Growth:

	Equatorial Guinea led with 66% growth, followed by Uganda (65%), Burundi (63%), and Tanzania/Burkina Faso (58% each).

o	Rural Population Growth:

	Burundi: 32%, Uganda: 29%, and Burkina Faso: 24%. Equatorial Guinea had minimal rural growth (12%).

11.	Preventive Treatment for Pregnant Women
    
o	Top-performing countries:

1.	Ghana: 165.59 women treated
   
3.	Zambia: 146.90 women treated
   
5.	Malawi: 115 women treated

7.	Trends in Malaria Incidence (Yearly)
   
i.	2007 recorded the highest malaria cases (10,500), followed by 2008 (10,200).

ii.	Gradual improvements were observed, with cases reducing to 8,800 in 2017.

Recommendations for African Countries

1.	Strengthen Healthcare Systems
   
i.	Scale up investments in healthcare infrastructure, focusing on malaria diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in high-incidence countries.

ii.	Improve distribution of insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medications to vulnerable populations, especially in rural areas.

3.	Enhance Preventive Measures
   
i.	Expand programs targeting pregnant women with preventive treatments to reduce maternal and neonatal malaria deaths.

ii.	Increase access to sanitation services, prioritizing rural communities for sustainable progress.

5.	Data-Driven Policy Interventions
   
i.	Regularly monitor and analyze malaria trends to identify and target high-risk regions.

ii.	Utilize data analytics tools to optimize resource allocation for malaria prevention and control programs.

7.	Public Awareness and Community Engagement
   
i.	Implement nationwide campaigns to educate communities on malaria prevention and treatment practices.

ii.	Partner with local stakeholders to ensure community buy-in and sustainability of interventions.

9.	Support Research and Development
    
i.	Encourage local innovations and research to develop cost-effective malaria control methods tailored to specific regional challenges.

ii.	Collaborate with international organizations for advanced solutions, including vaccine development and implementation.

11.	Address Socioeconomic Determinants
    
Integrate malaria control efforts with broader poverty reduction strategies to address underlying risk factors like poor housing and inadequate sanitation.

By adopting these recommendations, African countries can build on the progress achieved during the study period and accelerate the path toward malaria elimination.
